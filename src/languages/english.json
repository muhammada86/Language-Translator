            "2": "This number indicates how much fat is in a single serving of food. Although too much fat can lead to health problems, our bodies do need some fat every day. Fats are an important source of energy — they contain twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates or protein.",
            "3": "Saturated fatty acids (SFA) contain no double bond; this type of fat can be synthesized by the body and its major dietary source is food from animal sources, such as full-fat dairy products, red meat, and poultry.",
            "4": "Trans-fatty acids are manufactured fats created during a process called hydrogenation, which is aimed at stabilizing polyunsaturated oils to prevent them from becoming rancid and to keep them solid at room temperature. They may be particularly dangerous for heart health and may pose a risk for certain cancers.",
            "5": "The value for carbohydrate content of foods given in compositional tables usually is “carbohydrate by difference,” i.e., the residual weight after subtracting amounts of water, protein, fat, and ash found by analysis; this moiety includes sugars, starches, fiber, and small amounts of other organic compounds.",
            "6": "Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, includes the parts of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb. Unlike other food components, such as fats, proteins or carbohydrates — which your body breaks down and absorbs — fiber isn't digested by your body. Instead, it passes relatively intact through your stomach, small intestine and colon and out of your body. Fiber is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn't dissolve.",
            "7": "A sweet crystallizable material that consists wholly or essentially of sucrose, is colorless or white when pure tending to brown when less refined, is obtained commercially from sugarcane or sugar beet and less extensively from sorghum, maples, and palms, and is important as a source of dietary carbohydrate and as a sweetener and preservative of other foods",
            "8": "Proteins are the building blocks of life. Every cell in the human body contains protein. The basic structure of protein is a chain of amino acids. You need protein in your diet to help your body repair cells and make new ones.",
            "9": "Dietary cholesterol refers to cholesterol that enters the body through foods such as red meats, eggs, and fatty dairy products. It may not impact blood cholesterol as much as once thought, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).",
            "10": "Sodium is a mineral found in many foods. Your body needs sodium for normal muscle and nerve functions. It also helps keep body fluids in balance. Most table salts are made from sodium chloride. So, salt used when preparing or flavoring foods usually contains sodium.",
            "11": "Calcium is a mineral most often associated with healthy bones and teeth, although it also plays an important role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract, and regulating normal heart rhythms and nerve functions.",
            "12": "Iron is a mineral that is naturally present in many foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, an erythrocyte (red blood cell) protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues",
            "13": "Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin. This means that it dissolves in water and is delivered to the body's tissues but is not well stored, so it must be taken daily through food or supplements."
